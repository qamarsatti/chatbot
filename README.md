# Chatbot RAG: A Document-Based Chat System

Welcome to the Chatbot project! This web application allows users to upload their own documents and interact with them through a chat interface. Each user's documents are securely managed and kept separate from others. The system leverages Django, PostgreSQL vector database, and OpenAI APIs for embeddings and LLM capabilities.

## Features

### Authentication System
- User login and signup functionality.
- Secure authentication using Django's built-in auth module.

### Document Upload
- Users can upload their own documents.
- Each user's documents are stored and managed separately.

### Chat Module
- Users can interact with their uploaded documents through a chat interface.
- Queries are processed using OpenAI embeddings and LLM APIs.

### Vector Database
- Uses PostgreSQL vector database for efficient document embedding and retrieval.

### Dockerized Deployment
- Fully configured with Docker for easy setup and deployment.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Django
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (vector database enabled)
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI embeddings and LLM API
- **Containerization**: Docker
